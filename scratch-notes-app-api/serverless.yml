# Create an optimized package for our functions. 
# By default, Serverless Framework creates one large package for all 
# the Lambda functions in your app. Large Lambda function packages can 
# cause longer cold starts. By setting individually: true, we are telling 
# Serverless Framework to create a single package per Lambda function. 
# This in combination with serverless-bundle (and Webpack) will generate 
# optimized packages. Note that, thisâ€™ll slow down our builds but the performance 
# benefit is well worth it.
